Vidyard Video Downloader
This program has been created to download the source files of your Vidyard videos with thre right title. You will require a CSV file with the name and download url of the videos.

The CSV can be created manually using this Sample CSV file (only place name and source url in the right columns) or by using Magic CSV, which gives you a file with links to all videos and their names, which can be used as is.
To obtain a Magic CSV, open the Vidyard folder with videos that you want to download. Then copy and paste this url https://secure.vidyard.com/api/v1/videos/export.csv in the same window and press enter
Once you have the CSV, Upload it below and see the magic happen. All files will be downloaded sequentially. Please click allow when the browser asks for multiple downloads. Check the Browser Console for information on progress
